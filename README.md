# Udacity Secure & Private AI Mini-Projects

The purpose of this repo is to simplify the Mini-Projects of the Secure & Private AI Challenge from Udacity and Facebook.

## Installation

To run these notebooks you'll need to install Python 3.6+, PySyft, Numpy, PyTorch 1.0, and Jupyter Notebooks. The easiest way for all of this is to create a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n pysyft python=3
conda activate pysyft
conda install numpy jupyter notebook
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install syft
```
